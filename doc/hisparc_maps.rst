HiSPARC Maps
============

Each |hisparc| station is equipped with a GPS antenne. This GPS is used
to for time synchronization between stations and to determine the exact
location of each station. All these locations are stored in our
database. The GPS positions can be found on the data pages of stations,
via the API (:doc:`api`) and in the raw data.


OpenStreetMap
-------------

Using the free `OpenStreetMap <http://www.openstreetmap.org>`_ service
and the `OpenLayers <http://openlayers.org>`_ library we are able to
visualize the detector network by showing the locations of the stations
on a map.

Here is an overview of the network: `Stations on map
<http://data.hisparc.nl/show/stations_on_map/>`_


Controls
^^^^^^^^

To keep the map clean we do not show any controls on the map. However,
navigation is very intuitive and similar to what you may be familiar
with from other map services. The controls are as follows:

- Zooming
    - Double click on a location you want to zoom in on
    - Scroll with your mouse or trackpad to zoom in and out
- Moving
    - Click and drag the map to move it around
    
.. note::

    When you zoom in far enough the station numbers will be
    shown above the station indicators.


Status
^^^^^^

The stations on the map can have one of 4 colors to indicate the current
status of that station. The status is retrieved from the `HiSPARC
Monitoring System <http://vpn.hisparc.nl/>`_ when the page loads.

- Green: when a station is operating properly
- Yellow: it is responding to the server but has a problem
- Red: it is completely unresponsive (offline)
- Blue: it is is no longer active or the status can't be determined.


Embedding
---------

On several public database pages a map is embedded to show the station
location or provide an overview of multiple stations. Moreover, maps are
also used on our main website to give an overview of the station
organization and clustering (e.g. `Bristol
<http://www.hisparc.nl/over-hisparc/organisatie/bristol-uk/>`_, `Science
Park
<http://www.hisparc.nl/over-hisparc/organisatie/amsterdam/science-park/>`_
). This is accomplished by placing an iframe on those pages that
shows another page which only has the map as its content. Example code:

.. code-block:: html

    <iframe src="http://data.hisparc.nl/maps/Netherlands/Amsterdam/Science%20Park/"
            scrolling="no" frameborder="0" width="600" height="300"></iframe>

Result:

.. raw:: html

    <div style="margin-top:10px;">
      <iframe src="http://data.hisparc.nl/maps/Netherlands/Amsterdam/Science%20Park/"
            scrolling="no" frameborder="0" width="600" height="300"></iframe>
    </div>


Syntax
^^^^^^

To show a map of a specific region or location, use the syntax explained
here. First start with the base url::

    http://data.hisparc.nl/maps/

When no extra options are given the page zooms and positions the map
such that all stations fit in the window. But you can also focus on a
specific region or station. Several levels of regions are possible::

    http://data.hisparc.nl/maps/[Country]/[Cluster]/[Subcluster]/
    http://data.hisparc.nl/maps/[Station id]/

An overview of countries, clusters and subclusters can be found on
http://data.hisparc.nl/ . First you can choose to focus on a Country:

- http://data.hisparc.nl/maps/Netherlands/
- http://data.hisparc.nl/maps/Denmark/

Then focus more closely on a cluster, note that you also need to give
the country:

- http://data.hisparc.nl/maps/Netherlands/Enschede/
- http://data.hisparc.nl/maps/Netherlands/Utrecht/
- http://data.hisparc.nl/maps/United%20Kingdom/Bristol/

And to focus on a subcluster, also specifying the country and cluster:

- http://data.hisparc.nl/maps/Netherlands/Amsterdam/Zaanstad/
- http://data.hisparc.nl/maps/Netherlands/Enschede/Enschede/

Finally you can also focus on one specific station by simply giving its
station number:

- http://data.hisparc.nl/maps/8005/
- http://data.hisparc.nl/maps/8103/
