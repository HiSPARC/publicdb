"""Application Programming Interface for HiSPARC Public Database

The API simplifies data access for data contained in the
`HiSPARC Public Database <http://data.hisparc.nl>`_.  It was born out of the
need for easy access to up-to-date information about stations.

The following packages and modules are included:

:mod:`~api.urls`
    urls that can be called and will be passed on to functions

:mod:`~api.views`
    definitions that return specific data from the database
